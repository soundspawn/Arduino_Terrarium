Arduino_Terrarium
=================

Terrarium Controller for Arduino

This program is designed to controll an in-home terrarium environment as imagined by Ross Willett

##Terrarium specs:
- Approximate room size: 12x12x8<br/>
- Individual terrariums: 100+<br/>
  - Some 10 gallon glass (20"x10"x12")<br/>
  - Many insect cups (2/8/32 oz)<br/>
  - Some rubbermaid/sterilite containers<br/>

This is designed to run the terrarium with the assistance of a rest(ish) server.  See the <a href="https://github.com/soundspawn/Terrarium_D7_Module">Terrarium  D7 Module</a> for an example

##Arduino Software Features:
- Monitor temperature and humidity, activate space heater as needed
- Control LED lighting (RGB) with day/night cycles and transitions (wip)

##Needs:
- Humidity controls (swamp box?  Misters?)
- Ability to cool the room (AC wall unit?  Peltiers?)
- Individual tank controls (temperature and humidity, probabl via misters and peltiers) x10 or so
